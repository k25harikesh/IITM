    "### SQL Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Filtering Records\n",
    "\n",
    "- **WHERE**: Filter results based on conditions.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT * FROM Students WHERE Age > 20;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logical Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AND**: Combine multiple conditions where all must be true.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT * FROM Students WHERE Age > 20 AND Major = 'Computer Science';\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **OR**: Combine multiple conditions where at least one must be true.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT * FROM Students WHERE Age > 20 OR Major = 'Mathematics';\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NOT**: Negate a condition.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT * FROM Students WHERE NOT Age = 20;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sorting Results\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ORDER BY**: Sort the result set by one or more columns.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT * FROM Students ORDER BY Age DESC;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Aliases\n",
    "\n",
    "Temporary names for tables or columns to make queries easier to read and write.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Syntax**:\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT column_name AS alias_name\n",
    "    FROM table_name AS alias_name;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT e.FirstName AS First, e.LastName AS Last\n",
    "    FROM Employees AS e;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### JOINs\n",
    "\n",
    "Combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of JOINs**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **INNER JOIN**: Returns rows that have matching values in both tables.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT Employees.Name, Departments.DepartmentName\n",
    "    FROM Employees\n",
    "    INNER JOIN Departments ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)**: Returns all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right table. If no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT Employees.Name, Departments.DepartmentName\n",
    "    FROM Employees\n",
    "    LEFT JOIN Departments ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)**: Returns all rows from the right table and matched rows from the left table. If no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the left table.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT Employees.Name, Departments.DepartmentName\n",
    "    FROM Employees\n",
    "    RIGHT JOIN Departments ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)**: Returns rows when there is a match in one of the tables. If there is no match, the result is NULL on the side that does not have a match.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT Employees.Name, Departments.DepartmentName\n",
    "    FROM Employees\n",
    "    FULL OUTER JOIN Departments ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### UNION and UNION ALL\n",
    "\n",
    "Combines the result sets of two or more SELECT statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **UNION**: Removes duplicate records.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT Name FROM Employees\n",
    "    UNION\n",
    "    SELECT Name FROM Customers;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **UNION ALL**: Includes duplicate records.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT Name FROM Employees\n",
    "    UNION ALL\n",
    "    SELECT Name FROM Customers;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Subqueries\n",
    "\n",
    "A query within another query, used to perform operations that depend on the results of another query.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT Name FROM Employees\n",
    "    WHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees);\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### GROUP BY and HAVING\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GROUP BY**: Groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like \"find the number of employees in each department.\"\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT DepartmentID, COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount\n",
    "    FROM Employees\n",
    "    GROUP BY DepartmentID;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HAVING**: Filters records that work on summarized GROUP BY results.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT DepartmentID, COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount\n",
    "    FROM Employees\n",
    "    GROUP BY DepartmentID\n",
