    "- **CREATE**: Create a new table or database.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    CREATE TABLE Students (\n",

    "- **INSERT**: Add new records to a table.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    INSERT INTO Students (StudentID, Name, Age, Major) VALUES (1, 'Alice', 20, 'Computer Science');\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SELECT**: Retrieve data from the database.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",

    "#### Data Control Language (DCL)\n",
    "DCL is a subset of SQL used to control access to data in a database. It primarily deals with permissions and access control.\n",

    "- **EXECUTE**: Allows users to execute stored procedures or functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transaction Control Language (TCL)\n",
    "TCL commands are used to manage transactions in the database. Transactions are sequences of operations performed as a single logical unit of work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key TCL Commands**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **COMMIT**: Saves all changes made in the current transaction to the database.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",

    "    -- Example\n",
    "    INSERT INTO Employees (FirstName, LastName, Email) VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@example.com');\n",
    "    COMMIT;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ROLLBACK**: Undoes all changes made in the current transaction.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",

    "    -- Example\n",
    "    DELETE FROM Employees WHERE EmployeeID = 5;\n",
    "    ROLLBACK;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SAVEPOINT**: Sets a savepoint within a transaction to which you can later roll back.\n",
